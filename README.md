# Basics
Runs on nextjs  
is shitty af cause I cba to make an actual optimized site for 1 week before launch  

# If you want to help
either do pull request to add more nodes (would love help with the small ones)  
Or if you don't know how to do that stuff you can also create an issue by going to Issues > New Issue set title as the missing node name (e.g. S400, N123 etc.) and put a screenshot of it from video or w/e in the description.

I will look into it if I have the time.
