# Basics
Runs on nextjs  
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i love manually typing every small node

# If you want to help
either do pull request to add more nodes (would love help with the small ones)  
Or if you don't know how to do that stuff you can also create an issue by going to Issues > New Issue set title as the missing node name (e.g. S400, N123 etc.) and put a screenshot of it from video or w/e in the description.

I will look into it if I have the time.

# Data source
Like 95% of Notables/Keystones I took from this nice project https://marcoaaguiar.github.io/poe2-tree/ .
I created my own project because i wanted to add more features on my own and I don't know svelte.  
Most small passives I've found by slowly going over every video with skill tree that I could find.  
Some small nodes might be from the older playtest (8 months old i think, maybe 1/3rd of the bottom left small nodes in the map)), but newer videos have priority
